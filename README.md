## Introduction

Welcome to the Python crash course! In this course we have prepared videos and worksheets to teach you the basics of thee topics. We have split the topics into days, but go at your own pace. Maybe you speed through all the work sheets in one day, maybe it takes you a number of weeks. This page will still be here for you to use as educational material long after you start the cash course.

You will no doubt come into problems while coding, however many years of experience someone has in programming, Google is still your best friend! Sites such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>

## The course

### Day One
Today we have prepared a few work sheets to get you started. Today will be focused on the basics of code, and algorithmic thinking. COde is not simply "do this command", it is a language. Like any language it has syntax, structure/grammar, and has a flow to achieve something. 

Before we get started, make sure to download the software to run the worksheets. We will be working with notebooks, which are easy ways to learn to code. Notebooks can run online with <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a>, or run locally with software such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>. We have set this course up to run in VSCode, which will require a few things to set up. The benefits of colab is you have access to better performing computers, as the notebooks run on Google's servers. The downside is it requires a stable internet connection. VSCode runs locally, which means all your code is stored on your computer.
