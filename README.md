# PythonCrashCourse

## Introduction

Welcome to the Python crash course! In this course we have prepared videos and worksheets to teach you the basics of thee topics. We have split the topics into days, but go at your own pace. Maybe you speed through all the work sheets in one day, maybe it takes you a number of weeks. This page will still be here for you to use as educational material long after you start the cash course.

You will no doubt come into problems while coding, however many years of experience someone has in programming, Google is still your best friend! Sites such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/">W3schools</a>.

This course works by showing an associated video, and a link to the worksheet. You will need to download the worksheet by going to three horizontal dots near the top right of the screen and clicking download. OR you can hold down ```Ctrl``` ```Shift``` ```S``` to download the file.

## The course

### Day One
Today we have prepared a few work sheets to get you started. Today will be focused on the basics of code, and algorithmic thinking. COde is not simply "do this command", it is a language. Like any language it has syntax, structure/grammar, and has a flow to achieve something. 

Before we get started, make sure to download the software to run the worksheets. We will be working with notebooks, which are easy ways to learn to code. Notebooks can run online with <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a>, or run locally with software such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>. We have set this course up to run in VSCode, which will require a few things to set up. The benefits of colab is you have access to better performing computers, as the notebooks run on Google's servers. The downside is it requires a stable internet connection. VSCode runs locally, which means all your code is stored on your computer.

#### Task 1 - Algorithmic thinking
One of the hardest, but most important parts of programming is algorithmic thinking. Most courses gloss over this, but we want to install a problem solving mindset in you. This is not something that comes over night, but with practice. Doing <a href="https://leetcode.com/">Leetcode</a> questions, or other problem solving activities is the best way to keepthis skill up.

#### Task 2 - Maths through programming
Programming and maths are intertwined. Look at how we can do basic operations with Python

#### Task 3 - Data types
Understanding your data is key to making a program that uses it. This worksheet teaches you how to make different variables for different data, and how this is used.

* recapping bools vs numbers
* int vs float
* strings 
* lists 
* dictionaries

#### Summary
Today we have covered the basics of using the Python language. Keep practicing, and there are plenty of more tutorials online if you want to keep going on these topics:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/">W3schools</a>

### Day two

#### Task 1 - statements/expressions/logic


#### Task 2 - Flow of control

* introducing scope
* loop/iterator variables
  
[![flow](https://img.youtube.com/vi/HSeTorzswvc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSeTorzswvc)

<a href="https://github.com/SussexPAL/PythonCrashCourse/blob/main/Worksheets/day_2_flow_of_control.ipynb">Click here to view worksheet</a>

#### Task 3 - Functions
What if we want to execute the same bit of code multiple times throughout different parts of our program. Copying and pasting it will look messy, instead we can write it once as a function and rcall it whenever we need it.
* simple functions
* parameters
* return values
* default parameters

#### Task 4 - Understanding Errors & The Call Stack
What does an error actually mean? The way that we can understand when our code breaks is understanding the error itself!
* syntax error
* overflow/timeout error
* logic error
* try catch

### Day Three

#### Task 1 - Object oriented programming (OOP)
Object orientted programming is a practice of combining functionality into a blueprint that we call class. Lets say we have a video game with multiple players, instead of writing out code and variables to store all the player data, we have a player class that binds all this together.
* introduce OO concepts
* fields
* methods
* constructor

### Day 4

#### Task 1 - Scientific Python
First of all we need to understand numpy arrays and plotting data before we can dive into machine learning models.

#### Task 2 - Regression
Regression models are some of the simplest ML models. In simple terms they fit a line to data, however there are a few different approaches to this. This worksheet guides you through loading in a dataset, visualising it, and training a model to predict the data.
* data engineering practices
* simple linear regression
* multiple linear regression
* logistic linear regression
* evaluating and visualising results from models

### Day 5

#### Task 1 - Nueral networks
Nueral networks are some of the more exciting areas of machine learning and AI. This worksheet takes you through a nueral network, how to build one and train it on data. 
* artificial neural network
* convolutional neural network
* standardisation and imputing
