## Data types
* recapping bools vs numbers
* psych! There are actually TWO kinds of numbers (int vs float)
* strings (maybe characters...?)
* lists (fun fact strings can be treated like a list of chars)
* dictionaries

## Flow control
* introducing scope
* loop/iterator variables 

## Functions
* simple functions
* parameters
* return values
* default parameters
* maybe type hints...?
* maybe recursions...?

## Understanding errors
* syntax error
* overflow/timeout error
* logic error
* try catch

## OO 1 - what are classes
* introduce OO concepts
* fields
* methods
* constructor

# OO 2 - class interaction
* variables as object pointers
* objects as parameters of other objects
* classes as parameters of class methods

## OO 3 - inheritance
* basic inheritance
* calling super methods
* overriding
* multiple inheritance, and why Python doesn't allow it
* maybe the idea of abstract classes...?
